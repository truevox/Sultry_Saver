### General TODO

- [x] Create TODO document. :D

- [x] Begin integrating testing into what code I can. Refactor where needed.

- [ ] Refactor microprocessor code into two files, one that's testable without a microprocessor using pytest or doctests, and one that executes on the MP that ONLY contains non-testable, portable code.

- [ ] Establish a beta branch to go along with dev & main. Beta will allow downloading separate scripts via AHK (this will likely be #ApplicableAtWork).

- [ ] Consider a separate, pulled-on-demand script to do spell checking, ala https://www.autohotkey.com/download/AutoCorrect.ahk. Have it pull directly from there on new download, but, assuming it fails (will have to build a failure checker - yay TDD) I should also have a version in the repo.

- [ ] Integrate personal #TODO via hotkey (and out of this file, but it should be able to WRITE TO and DISPLAY this file (SUPER #ApplicableAtWork)). See below TODO TODO section for more about this.

- [ ] Re-create option to pull known-working code from Master down to D:\ (shouldn't be hard)



### TODO TODO

- [ ] Can write to this very TODO file (or any other place). User should get the option to select where to write on first use.
- [ ] On first run

- [ ] Simple hotkey should call up an easy way to add to the TODO (this will ALSO have a "Show TODO" button and a "Config" button).

- [ ] Show TODO button should launch a short screen, parsing through the TODO file. Use the "Auto Help Gen" as a prototype parser.

- [ ] There should be check boxes and they should "work" (which is to say they should write to the file).

- [x] Switch from TabMemFree to THE GREAT SUSPENDER
